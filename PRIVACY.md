# Privacy Policy for FluxOrigin

**Last updated:** December 04, 2025

## 1. Introduction
FluxOrigin ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application handles your data.

**The most important point:** FluxOrigin is designed as a local-first application. We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data, files, or translation content to any cloud servers controlled by us.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

### 2.1. Personal Information
We do not collect any personal information (such as name, email address, phone number, or location data) when you use FluxOrigin.

### 2.2. User Content (Files and Text)
FluxOrigin allows you to open and translate document files (such as .TXT and .EPUB).
* **Local Processing:** All file parsing and reading happen locally on your device.
* **No Uploads:** Your files are **never** uploaded to our servers.

## 3. Generative AI and Translation

FluxOrigin utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) features to provide translation services.

* **Local AI Models:** The application connects to local AI models running on your device (e.g., via Ollama).
* **Data Privacy:** Since the AI models run locally on your machine or local network, the text you translate is processed within your own environment. No text data is sent to external third-party API providers or our servers for generation.

## 4. Analytics
The application does not integrate third-party analytics SDKs that track user behavior or crash reports. Any logs generated by the application are stored locally on your device for debugging purposes (`Dev Logs`) and are not transmitted to us unless you manually choose to share them via email for support.

## 5. Internet Access
FluxOrigin may require internet access solely for the purpose of:
* Verifying license/purchase status from the Microsoft Store.
* Downloading updates if applicable.
It does not use the internet to transmit your content.
